# CKAD Practice Repository

Welcome to my **CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) Practice Repository**.  
This repo contains **topic-wise Kubernetes practice questions with answers**, designed to help revise and practice CKAD concepts.

> Each folder contains 5â€“10 questions per topic with **answers in CKAD-ready YAML**.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the topic folder you want to practice.  
2. Open the question file (e.g., `Q1.md`) and read the question.  
3. Try to solve it on your local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, Kind, or EKS).  
4. Compare your solution with the provided **CKAD-ready YAML** answer.
